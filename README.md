# Heap_Sort
It is an implementation of Heap Sort in C# designed for project submission purpose using Max heap technique

            How To code??
First we build a max heap from input data.
The root of heap is set as the largest element.

Now we replace it with the last item of the heap.
Then we follow it by reducing the size of heap by 1.
The process is repeated until heap value is greater than 1.

Heapification is done through bottom up order.
